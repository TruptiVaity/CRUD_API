Description:

An API using Golang providing standard CRUD operations on a resource.
Resource: Books Data
Parameters of a Book: ISBN, Author, Title, Price

API consists of following criteria:
- An endpoint to create a new item: createBook
- An endpoint to read an item: getBook
- An endpoint to read all items: getBooks
	o Set this endpoint up 3 different query parameters used to filter the
		books:  1. Filter books with Author name
				2. Filter books with Title 
				3. Filter books with price less than the entered value
- An endpoint to update an item: updateBook.
- An endpoint to delete an item: deleteBook.

This API collects the data from a JSON file "books.json".
Create new book entry: Takes the input. Find the maximum ID value present in the data. New ID is generated by incrementing the maximum value by 1.
Update a book: Delete the current entry and creates a new entry in the same place. ID of the entry remains intact.
Delete a book: Removes the entry from the data.
Read All items:
	If query is present, filter the books by query.
	Else return all the items present in the datastore.
FilterByQuery:
	1. Query with name "author" checks for the authors present in the datastore.
	2. Query with name "title" checks for book titles.
	3. Query with name "price" checks for all the books with less than or equal to the value entered by the user. 
	4. Using more than one query at a time separated by "&" helps in narrowing your search results.
